# Plugload-dataset
Dataset contains signatures of plug loads operating in varying voltage conditions. Total 70 plug load/devices of seven types such as CPU, Kettle, Laptop, Monitor, Printer, Projector and Network switch are included. Each device type has 10 devices of different make/brands.Samples are collected at 4 voltages 200V, 210V, 220V and 230V. For a device in single state in a specified voltage range, 24 samples of energy consumption are collected. The duration is 2 minutes, at the rate of 1 sample per 5 second. The data iscaptured in different device operating states. For example, in laptops the data is captured in fully charged and fully discharged states. The total samples in the data set are 14400.There are 36 features such as V (voltage), I (Current), P (Active Power), S (Apparent Power), Q (Reactive Power), PF (Power Factor) etc.
